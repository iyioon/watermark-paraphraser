Hi Ian,

We're holding a meeting on the current problems with the computer systems and I'd appreciate it if you could come. Having somebody like yourself there from the legal department is important because of the problems we've had with the loss of customer data.

The meeting will take place next Thursday at 2pm in meeting room 3 in the Corley Building in Leeds.

If there's anything you would like to discuss in the meeting, send it to me by email and I'll include it in the meeting's agenda.

Let me know as soon as possible if you can attend.

Regards,

David Mitchell
IT Project Manager
