Hi Simon,

I hope you are fine and had a good holiday?

We went to Portugal two years ago. It's a beautiful place and the people are very friendly.

I was wondering if you could do me a favour. I'm writing a presentation on 'changes in modern marketing' to give at the international marketing conference next week. I've nearly finished it and I think it sounds ok. But I think that the PowerPoint slides for the presentation look terrible.

I know that you are very good at creating slides on PowerPoint (your slides always look very professional). Would you mind having a look at them?

I just need you to have a look at them and suggest how I can make them look more professional. There are about 12 slides for the presentation. It shouldn't take longer than an hour to do it. I'd really appreciate it if you could help me.

I would have asked Kevin in my team to check them for me, but he's on holiday until after the conference.

It's no problem if you can't, but could you let me know as soon as you can?

Sorry for asking you to do this, but I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.

Regards,

Ian Flynn
