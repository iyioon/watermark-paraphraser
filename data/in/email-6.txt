Dear Mrs Boswell,

I wish to draw your attention to an issue we have with a recent order from yourselves (ref no. 34ED12QP). Not only was the delivery four days later than agreed, but when we tried to use the components, we found that 40% of them were damaged and basically useless.

As is normal, I spoke to your Customer Service Manager, Peter Taylor on this matter. I expected that you would replace the damaged components, but this has not been the case. When I last spoke to Peter, last week, he informed me that the components were undamaged when delivered to us and that it was our fault. To make matters worse, he has still not replied to an email I sent to him on Monday. Not very professional customer service.

As you are aware, we have been a customer of your company for over 5 years. The damaged components are severely impacting our production at the moment. We have orders which we can not send because of this problem with the components.

Although I appreciate that you are all very busy, I believe that I am entitled to an explanation why Peter Taylor has not answered my email, and is refusing to replace the components.

Unless this issue is resolved promptly, then unfortunately, we will be forced to take further action.

I expect an email from yourself by 5pm today at the latest, to inform me how you are going to resolve this issue.



Yours sincerely,


Craig Smith 
EGO Production Director
