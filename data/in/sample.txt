Hi all,

There will be no physical tutorial sessions on Week 3 but the lecture on 27 Jan will still go on. 

I've just uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please see within for instructions on submitting the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4pm (Week 4).

Note that tutorial 1 will be based on the lectures this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3). So, you can work on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Bryan
