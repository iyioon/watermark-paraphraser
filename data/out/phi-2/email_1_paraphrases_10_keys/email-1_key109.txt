Hi there,

Week 3 will have no in-person tutorial sessions, but the Thursday lecture will happen. 

I only have one fact to share: I uploaded tutorial 1 to the Uploads section of Tutorial & Project Assignments. Please check out the descriptions that explain the steps required to undergo the grading process and the deadline for submission, which is 3 February, 4pm (Week 4).

Just keep in mind that the first step should be completed after the lecture on 27 January (Week 3), which covers only the Lectures from this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3).

Bryan
