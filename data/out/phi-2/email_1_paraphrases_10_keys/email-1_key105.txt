Hi all,

There will be no physical tutorial sessions in Week 3 but the lecture on January 27 will still take place. 

I have just uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please find instructions for submitting the graded solutions by February 4, at 4pm (Week 4) in the tutorial folder. 

I want to remind you that tutorial 1 is based on this week's lectures and the next week's lectures (Week 2 and 3). Hence, you can work on it after the lecture on January 27 (Week 3).

Bryan
