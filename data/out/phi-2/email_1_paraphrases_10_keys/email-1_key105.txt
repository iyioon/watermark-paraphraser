The following message can be paraphrased:

I am writing to inform you that Week 3 does not involve any hands-on classes but the upcoming lecture on 27 Jan will proceed as planned. 

A downloadable version of tutorial 1 can be found in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please find a description of how to submit the graded solutions for Week 4, which ends at 4 pm on blades, beginning 3 February, by using the link below. 

Please be reminded that for this task, tutorial 1 will draw from the concepts taught in Week 2 and also in Week 3. So, you are free to review it after the aforementioned lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Bryan
