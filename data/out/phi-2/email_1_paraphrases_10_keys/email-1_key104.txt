Let me inform you that there will not be any physical tutorial sessions for Week 3, but the lecture that will take place on 27 Jan (Week 1) will still proceed. 

I have attached tutorial number 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder for your convenience. Please refer to the document in the folder for details on how to submit the graded solutions by 3 Feb (Week 4) from 4pm. 

Please note that tutorial number 1 will be based on the lectures from Week 2 and the one that will take place in Week 3. Therefore, you can complete it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Regards,
Bryan
