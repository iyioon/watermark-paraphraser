Hi everyone,

There won't be any in-person tutorials on Week 3, but the lecture for the 27th of January will still occur.

I've just put tutorial 1 in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. You can go through it in Week 4 and submit the graded solutions by 3 "pm" on the 4th of February.

Remember that tutorial 1 will be founded on lessons from Week 2 and Week 3, which means after the lecture on the 27th, you can actually start working on it.
