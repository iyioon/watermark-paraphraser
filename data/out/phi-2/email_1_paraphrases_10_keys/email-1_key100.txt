Hi everyone,

I'm writing this email to inform you that there will be no do-it-yourself (DIY) workshops on Week 3 but the talk on 27 Jan will still proceed.

On that day, I've attached tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. To complete the assignment, you must submit the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4pm (Week 4).

Please note that this assignment will be derived from the lectures of this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3), so you can begin working on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Bryan
