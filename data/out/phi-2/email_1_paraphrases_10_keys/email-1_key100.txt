Hi all,

Unfortunately, there won't be any face-to-face tutorial sessions on Week 3 but the lecture scheduled for 27 January is still scheduled.

I have uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder, and make sure to check there for instructions on all the graded tasks. According to the instructions, the graded solutions will be due on 3 February at 4:00 PM for Week 4.

Please be aware: Tutorial 1 will be informed by the lectures from this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3). Therefore, you can commence working on it after the lecture on 27 January (Week 3).

Bryan
