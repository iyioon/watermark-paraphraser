Dear colleagues,

You won't find any in-person tutorial sessions scheduled for Week 3. However, the lecture from 27 Jan remains as planned.

I have just added tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. To receive the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 16:00 (Week 4), please follow the instructions in the attached document.

Please bear in mind that tutorial 1 is related to the lectures we covered in this week (Week 2) and the upcoming week (Week 3). Therefore, please use the time between the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3) and the lecture on 28 Jan (Week 2) to work on it.

Best regards,
Bryan
