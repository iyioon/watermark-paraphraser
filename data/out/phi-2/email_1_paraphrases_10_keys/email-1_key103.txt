Hi all,

No physical tutorial sessions are scheduled for Week 3, however, there will be a lecture on 27 Jan. 

For Week 4, I have uploaded the first tutorial titled "Tutorial 1" to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. The graded solutions for this tutorial are due by 4pm (Week 4) on Feb 3. 

Please be reminded that Tutorial 1 is predicated on the lectures from Week 2 and the upcoming Week 3. Hence, it would be advisable to commence working on it immediately following the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Best,
Bryan
