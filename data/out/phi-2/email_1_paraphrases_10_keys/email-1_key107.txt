Hi all,

Stay tuned as week three does not have a physical tutorial session but the lecture scheduled for 27 Jan will still feature.

I've just made tutorial 1 available for you to find in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please find the necessary submission guidelines in the same folder to complete the graded solutions on 4 Feb (Week 4) by 3pm.

One important reminder, this tutorial is derived from the week two lecture and the week three lecture. That means, you could handle solving it after the 27 Jan - week three lecture.

Bryan
