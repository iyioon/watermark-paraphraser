Dear team members,

The schedule for this week has not changed, but a lecture will still take place on 27 January. 

I'm pleased to inform you that the first tutorial has been uploaded to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please consult within for instructions on presenting the graded solutions by 4 February, 14:00 (Week 4).

Please note that tutorial 1 is linked to the lectures delivered during this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3). Therefore, you can choose to complete it after the lecture on 27 January (Week 3).

Best regards,
Bryan
