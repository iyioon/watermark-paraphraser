Hi everyone,

Unfortunately, we will not be conducting any in-person tutorials during Week 3 but the live lecture for 27 Jan will still be happening. 

I have uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. You can find guidance on how to submit the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4:00 p.m. (Week 4) inhawk's email. 

Bear in mind that the tutorials for Week 1 will be used to study for this week's lecture (Week 2) and next week's (Week 3). You can therefore work on tutorial 1 after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).
