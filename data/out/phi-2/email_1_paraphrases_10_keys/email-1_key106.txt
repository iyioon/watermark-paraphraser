Possible paraphrase:

Hello everyone,

For Week 3, we won't have any face-to-face training, but the lecture on 27 Jan will continue as planned.

Please check the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder for the link to tutorial 1. You should submit the graded solutions for the assignment by 3 Feb, 4 pm (Week 4), using the link.

Note that tutorial 1 will be based on the lessons we learned this week (Week 2) and the next week (Week 3). Therefore, you can do it after the lecture on 27 Janhawk (Week 3) without any hassle.

Bryan.
