Dear team,

The week 3 tutorial sessions will not physically occur. Nevertheless, the lecture on 27 January will continue. 

As of today, I've uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please observe the guidelines for submitting the graded solutions by 3 February, 4:00pm (Week 4).

Reminder, tutorial 1 shall utilize the lectures from this week (Week 2) and the upcoming week (Week 3). Therefore, feel free to engage in its task after the lecture on 27 January (Week 3).

Best Regards,
Bryan
