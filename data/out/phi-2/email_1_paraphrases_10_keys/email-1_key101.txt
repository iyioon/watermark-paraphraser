Dear everyone,

As there will be no in-person tutorial sessions on Week 3, while the lecture scheduled for 27 Jan continues.

I have now posted tutorial 1 in the Tutorial and Project Assignments folder. In order to submit the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4 pm (Week 4), kindly refer to the instructions submitted.

Remember, the focus of tutorial 1 will involve both the lectures from Week 2 and Week 3. Hence, rather than undertaking this task during Week 3, we are better positioned to continue with it following the lecture on 27 Jan in Week 3.

Best regards,
Bryan
