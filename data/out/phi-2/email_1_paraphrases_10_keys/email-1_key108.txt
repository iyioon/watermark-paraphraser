Dear Team,

There will be no face-to-face demo sessions on Week 3 instead the lecture on 27 Jan will continue as planned.

You've now received tutorial 1 in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please check out the information provided within regarding the deadline for submitting the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4pm (Week 4).

Don't forget that tutorial 1 is linked to the lectures in Week 2 and Week 3. Therefore, you can start working on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Sincerely,
Bryan
