Hi all,

Week 3 won't have any physical tutorial sessions, but the lecture on 27 Jan will still take place.

I have now uploaded Tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please find the instructions on how to submit your graded solution by 3 Feb, at 4pm (Week 4) in the folder.

It's important to know that Tutorial 1 will be based on the lectures from this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3). Therefore, you can choose to work on it after attending the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).
 
Bryan
