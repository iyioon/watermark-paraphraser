Hello everyone,

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, no in-person tutorial sessions will be possible in Week 3. However, the lecture on 27 Jan will still be live.

I have just uploaded and made available tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. For more information, please check within for details on how to submit the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4pm (Week 4).

Please note that tutorial 1 will cover the topics from this week (Week 2) and the next week (Week 3). Therefore, you can start working on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Done with thank

Bryan
