Hi everyone,

No physical tutorial sessions scheduled for Week 3, but the lecture scheduled for 27 Jan is still in the calendar.

Congratulations! I have uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. For further information on submitting the graded solution by 3 Feb, 4pm (Week 4), please refer to the attached document.

I want to remind you that we are using the scripts from Week 2 and Week 3 to solve the problems in tutorial 1, so you can work on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Best,
Bryan
