Dear team,

There won't be any scheduled physical teaching on the third week, however, the lecture on 27th of January will proceed as planned.

I have recently uploaded tutorial 1 which is available in the 'Tutorial and Project Assignments' folder. Please make sure to adhere to the submission guidelines, which are to complete the graded solutions by 3rd of February, 4 pm (week 4).

It's important to keep in mind that tutorial 1 will depend on the lectures from this week's (week 2) as well as next week's (week 3). Therefore, it is advisable to work on it after the lecture on 27th January (week 3).

Best regards,
Bryan
