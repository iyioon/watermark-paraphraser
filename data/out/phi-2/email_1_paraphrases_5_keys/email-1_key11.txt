The third week of 2021/2022 semester will have no in-person classes on Week 3 but the lecture on 27 Jan 2021 will proceed as planned.

I have just posted tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. To get the graded solutions by the due date of 4 pm (Week 4) on 3 Feb 2021, please refer to the document enclosed for the instructions.

Be aware that this project hinges on the lectures of inspecting Week 2 and Week 3 sequentially. Given the relevance of the content, I recommend you to begin working on it after the concluding lecture on 27 Jan 2021 (Week 3).

Best,
Bryan
