Hello everyone,

You will not receive any live tutorial sessions for Week 3, but we will still offer the lecture on January 27. 

I have just posted tutorial 1 in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. You can find detailed guidelines on how to submit your graded assignments by 4:00 PM (Week 4).

It's worth mentioning that tutorial 1 is formulated using concepts discussed in Week 2 and Week 3 lectures. Therefore, you can work on it after the lecture on January 27 (Week 3).

Warm regards,
Bryan
