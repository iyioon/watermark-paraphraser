Hi everyone,

Week 3 will not have any physical tutorial sessions but the lecture scheduled on 27 Jan will still take place. 

I have just transferred tutorial 1 to our Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. For further details on submitting your graded solutions by 4 pm on the 3rd of February (Week 4), please visit the folder.

Please take note that tutorial 1's content aligns with the lecture material that we covered this week (Week 2) as well as the upcoming week (Week 3). Consequently, you are advised to complete it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Regards,
Bryan
