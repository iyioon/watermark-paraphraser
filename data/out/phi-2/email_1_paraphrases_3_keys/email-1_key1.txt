Dear team,

You won't participate in any on-site training sessions on Week 3, but the departmental lecture scheduled for 27 Jan won't be postponed.

For your assistance, I have uploaded tutorial 1 to the Tutorial and Project Assignments folder. Please refer to the enclosed guidelines for submitting the graded solutions by 3 Feb, which shall be the beginning of Week 4.

To gain a comprehensive understanding, make sure to review tutorial 1 which draws concepts from Week 2 and Week 3. You should attempt the tutorial at your own pace after the lecture on 27 Jan.

Best,

Bryan
