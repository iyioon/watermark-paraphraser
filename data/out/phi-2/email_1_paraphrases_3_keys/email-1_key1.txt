A possible paraphrase is:

Dear colleagues,

Week 3 will not have any in-person training sessions, but the lecture on 27 Jan of Week 3 is still scheduled.

I have attached tutorial 1 to the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Could you please follow the instructions in the attachment to submit the graded solutions for Week 4 by 3 February, which is 4pm?

Keep in mind that tutorial 1 is based on the lectures from this week (Week 2) and next week (Week 3). Therefore, you can engage in tutorial 1 after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Bryan
