Possible paraphrased email:

Hello everyone,

You will not have any face-to-face training sessions on Week 3, but the lecture that will take place on 27 Jan will still be scheduled.

Feel free to access tutorial 1 from the file sharing system and read how to exchange your graded solutions by 3 Feb, 15:00 (Week 4) within the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder.

Please keep in mind that tutorial 1 is derived from the topics that were discussed in Lecture n (Week 2) and Lecture n+1 (Week 3). Therefore, you may start working on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Best regards,
Bryan
