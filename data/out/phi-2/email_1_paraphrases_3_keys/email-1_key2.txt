Hi all,

No physical tutorial sessions will be held on Week 3, but the lecture on 27 January will still take place. 

Please find tutorial 1 within the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. The graded answers should be submitted to us by 3 February, 4pm (Week 4). 

Remember, the tutorial 1 will reflect the themes covered in the lectures which took place on Week 2 and Week 3. Therefore, you can attain it after the lecture of 27 January (Week 3).

Cheers,
Bryan
