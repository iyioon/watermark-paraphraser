An email with the same information as the original, but with different words and sentence structures. For example:

You should not expect any in-person training sessions for Week 3, but the daily seminar will continue. 

I have completed tutorial 1 and placed it in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please follow the guidelines in the folder to submit your marked solutions by 3 February, 16:00 (Week 4).

Please note that tutorial 1 is derived from the lectures in Week 2 and Week 3. Therefore, you can postpone its start until after the lecture on 27 January (Week 3).
