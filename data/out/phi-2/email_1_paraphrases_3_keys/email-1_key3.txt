Please note that there will no in-person tutorial sessions for Week 3, though the lecture on 27 Jan will still occur. 

If you want to view and complete the graded homework, you should check out tutorial 1. You must submit this graded work by 3 Feb, 4pm (Week 4).

This tutorial is based on the previous week's lecture and the next week's material. You are therefore encouraged to work on it after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3). 

Warm Regards,

Bryan
