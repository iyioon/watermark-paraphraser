Hi everybody,

Week 3's physical tutorial won't take place. On the other hand, the lecture scheduled for 27 Jan will still go ahead. 

By now, you should have accessed tutorial 1 in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. The instructor has provided us with clear guidelines for submitting the graded solutions by 3 Feb, 4pm of the same week (Week 4).

It's critical to understand that tutorial 1 is contingent upon the lectures we had in Week 2 and Week 3. It is, therefore, advisable that Bas is your last stop to complete the tutorials after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).
