Greetings everyone,

For Week 3, there will be no practical demonstrations but the lecture on 27 Jan will still proceed.

I have posted tutorial 1 in the Tutorial & Project Assignments folder. Please check with me within the next four working days (from 3 Feb to 4 Feb, 3:00 PM) for detailed instructions regarding the submission of the graded assignments by 3 Feb, 4:00 PM (Week 4).

Please also note that tutorial 1 will take into account the lectures for Week 2 and Week 3. This means that you can focus on this tutorial after the lecture on 27 Jan (Week 3).

Bryan
