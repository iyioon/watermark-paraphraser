Hi Ian,
I'm sending you an email to let you know that I have an added request now for you to attend the meeting next Thursday at 2pm in Corley Building in Leeds. I'm hoping that you could at minimum discuss the big issues about computer system loss in the last few weeks. I know it's good practice to put certain kinds of messy problem on the agenda, but sometimes the situation makes everybody angry. I request you to make up your mind and simply answer the question, If I would need someone else to come why don't we appoint someone from Legal to address this specific problem?!
