Dear Ian,

I need you to attend a meeting next Thursday in the Corley Building (Dec 17) from 12:00 till 2:00 in room 3. I need you to come because the loss of customer data is of critical importance for the company.

The meeting will last 1.5 hours and we'll meet for lunch afterwards. I can provide refreshments and soft drinks.
