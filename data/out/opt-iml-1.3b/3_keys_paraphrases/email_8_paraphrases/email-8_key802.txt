Dear team,

I am reaching out to share important updates regarding changes to our organizational structure at Vertex Dynamics, effective May 1, 2025. These adjustments are aimed at optimizing operations, improving collaboration, and aligning our structure with our long-term strategic goals.  

In line with this restructuring, the Business Strategy Department will be integrated with the Market Intelligence Team to form the new Strategic Growth Division. This change will allow for a more data-driven approach to decision-making, and business expansion. Additionally, the Operations Support Team will be consolidated under the Service Excellence Department to enhance process efficiency and customer experience.  

In line with these changes, Michael Stanton will take on the role of Senior Vice President of Strategic Growth, overseeing market analysis and corporate strategy. Rachel Wong, who previously led Operations Support, will now serve as Director of Service Excellence. Employees within Business Strategy and Market Intelligence will now report to Michael Stanton, while those in Operations Support will transition to reporting under Rachel Wong.  

To facilitate a smooth transition, a company-wide briefing will be held on April 25, 2025, at 2:00 PM in the auditorium. During this session, we will provide further insights into these changes and address any questions you may have. Additionally, department leaders will schedule follow-up discussions to ensure clarity and alignment at the team level.  

We understand that organizational changes may raise questions, and we encourage you to reach out to your managers or contact HR Director, Samuel Tan, at samuel.tan@vertexdynamics.com for any inquiries.  

Thank you for your ongoing dedication and commitment to Vertex Dynamics. We look forward to working together as we embrace these changes and continue striving for excellence.  
  
Best regards,  
Elena Foster  
Chief Executive Officer  
Vertex Dynamics
