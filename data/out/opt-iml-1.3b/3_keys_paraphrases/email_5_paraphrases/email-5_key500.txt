Hello,
I'm currently writing a presentation on "changes in modern marketing" at the international marketing conference (IBC) in Amsterdam. Which I think sounds good but am having trouble, although I've nearly finished it. I've decided to focus on the overall design of the presentation rather than on specific slides or graphics.
However, when I'm going to give the presentation at the conference (in Amsterdam) I would most definitely like to use as my PowerPoint slides the slides I've created here to somewhat improve the presentation situation.

So, I would gladly accept your help if you could comment on the following 12 slides ([first 5 screenshots below :D]), so I can be sure that I can use them in Amsterdam with a great presentation.

Thanks!

Sincerely,
Ian Flynn
