Dear Mrs Boswell,

I enclose the following documents:
- Your email address
- Forwarded email: delivery time, damaged-not-replaced-components-case
- Thumbnails: black grey

Please respond to my email by 5pm today. The damaged components are severely harming our business at this critical moment. I beg you, work with me and this situation will not happen again. Thank you.
