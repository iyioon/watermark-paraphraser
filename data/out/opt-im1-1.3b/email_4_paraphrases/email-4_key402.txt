Dear Peter,

Firstly, thank you for your excellent message concerning our proposed re-design of our company's website. Although I do not agree with the general criticisms raised in the comments which you had included on your previous email, I would obviously like to clarify my point of view in relation to one of the main purposes that prevails behind the redesign.

From our first impressions of yourHuman Resources Department website we have found that it is much more difficult and unfamiliar to use and secondly it is outdated, which is why we introduced the following changes:
-1. Making the glass tab with 50 Bolding (?) more prominent in order to improve visibility;
-2. Reducing the size of the homepage from 800 px to 600 px;
-3. Adding a longer description of our services in the first page and in bigger fonts;
-4. Implanting a call to action button to the left of the homepage for those visitors who want to register for our survey and / or for interactive forms or forms which allow the user to send emails.

In my opinion, these proposed changes, declared as "Test endeavor" are perfectly valid. They help us to communicate effectively, make the visitors more focused on the main area of the website and to optimize user experience.

The content and formating of the quote message on the homepage is very important for the usability of the website. If we would have discussed about the contents of the masthead more thoroughly before, this would obviously have been the first point of discussion in relation to the overall design of the homepage.

As for "Frequent Users" Answers, we triedHuman Resources Department website to organize a feedback loop with visitors who liked the website. However, most of the websites were structured very pre-designed. We believe that you should find classes or classes which unambiguously distinguishes frequent visitors from regular visitors in order to improve customer experience. For this purpose, most of the websites in the market have employed two methods of accounting: The first is the definition of frequent visitors based on the statistical data gathered through a survey or by manually manipulating charts scheduled for key points on the time table. In such cases there is a chance of drawbacks.

In practice, the definition of frequent visitors could be useful when only tracking visitors within a specific period of time. However, when it is relevant for maintaining the alert service, then the endeavor is perilous. Numerous investigations in the market clearly confirm the impossibility of carrying out a validation for the term frequent users. Basically, internet psychology has found the objective impossibility of developing a special code of judgment for the frequent visited category based solely on case statistics. Thus, serious errors, like the ones discussed above, which could lead to erroneous printing of the perception of visitors on the basis of such a category of people. In addition, continual evolution of the filtering system applied to different categories of members of the frequent visited category canHuman Resources Department website lead to discrepancies between defined and measured values, which can entail great consequences for the reputation of the company involved. So, even if the company coincides with the classification of frequent visitors unambiguously and discretely, there could be discrepancies, which could affect the rating provided by our energy solutions by exacerbating the reputation damage caused by the inaccurate accounting. The subsequent development of the filtering system is very important before developing the filtering system suitably for all our customers.

In sum, we are convinced that we have reduced the overall price for the re-design of your company's website significantly without impairing the functionality of the site. Under normal circumstances, the price of this operation would include additional technical support, but the technical service attached to the endeavor is excluded, which could cause further tens of thousands of dollars.

Thanks again for your cooperation and for your interest in our company.

Best regards,

William Smith
