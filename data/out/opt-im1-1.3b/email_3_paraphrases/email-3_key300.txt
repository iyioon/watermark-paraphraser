Ian,

Our meeting next Thursday is scheduled at 2 pm in Corley Building Room 3. We are currently having problems with some computer systems and I would appreciate it if you could come to our meeting. We'll be discussing the current problems with the computer system and can discuss the proposal further down. I have attached some FAQs with the agenda.
