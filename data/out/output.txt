“They knew there was something out there and they did everything in their power to keep us in the ignorance,” said Paul Saatchay, a VP and pilot. “We certainly did not know what was going on.”

The reason why Singapore kept it a secret despite its size and ubiquity was that when planes fly by, they have to fly at low visibility conditions that greatly increase both the risk of machine failures and the chance of catastrophic accidents from the dynamism of flying vehicles. Without the kind of warning that comes from knowing precisely where a plane is, pilots have to react within seconds and prepare to turn back.
