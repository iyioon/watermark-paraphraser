Dear Mr Taylor,

We are working on a matter with you pertaining to material delivered to us in individual containers. We would appreciate you providing the following information:

- Details from your Credit Guarantee Agreement
- The name of the User Service Provider responsible for the delivery
- Your telephone number and email address
- The first element of the e-mail subject (you can add adding this to the body of the text if you wish)

Needless to say, those who are very polite are often treated rudely. That's why you need some courtesy. Penpal and interviewers testify this trait.

Kind regards,

Craig Smith
