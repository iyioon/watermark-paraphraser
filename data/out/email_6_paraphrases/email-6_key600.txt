Hi Mr. Boswell,

Recently we have received a chassis order from you. Unfortunately GEO has received a number of quality issues from this order. We have had to bring order of chassis number 34ED12QP back to you to replace the faulty component. The component which is causing most problems is a ceramic magnet structure which we have been known to experienced a lot of problems on during production process. Essentially, this component is very fragile and is only used for purpose of cutting high conductivity connections on magnetic documents. The broken component causes whole shaft of our system to be careless causing safety integrity issue with bearings on our MICOYS drills. We need someone to offer very honest and transparent communication to us.

The components were delivered damaged and our delivery time has considerably increased from normal to 4 days. The actual parts being damaged work as intended by GE when they were delivered. They could maybe have been delivered to you quicker but they were damaged. Customers are entitled to have their product as ordered. Thank you
